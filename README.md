GhostDock is a lightweight Windows Forms app built with .NET 7.0 and C#, designed to streamline your audio control experience for everyday school meetings, work calls, and gaming sessions. It runs discreetly in your system tray, giving you real-time audio control over multiple applications â€” without needing to switch between them. Easily mute, adjust volume, or add custom apps to the control list, all from a sleek tray menu interface.
